Hack The Vote
===

Hack The Vote lasted 48 hours and started on Nov 4th 2016 at 7pm EDT. We themed both the website and the challenges after the US election in the hopes of making a hilarious CTF, but also to draw some attention to the idea.

We had a great time running the CTF and hanging out with the teams on IRC, and we loved all the positive feedback on CTFtime. Thank you to all the teams that participated!

If there's a challenge, solution, setup, etc missing from this repo that you're interested in then hit us up on our [IRC](https://rpis.ec/irc)!

Special thanks to everyone who contributed their time or a challenge!
